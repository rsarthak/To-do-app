## What is this?

**TO DO List** is a simple API project created with everything that I learned on course [Do Zero ao Deploy](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/do_zero_ao_deploy) by [CÃ¡ssio Botaro](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/).

This project covers the following concepts:
- Python environments with [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)
- Test Driven Development with [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
- Starting with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework
- Continuous Integration with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
- Continuous Deployment with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

Starting from what has been taught, I improved the API with **MongoDB** persistence.

## Environment
### API
All code was written with **Python 3.6**, so, for a correct running, it is recommended to install this one.

After Python installed, it is required to install all dependencies. You can use [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) or [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). If you are using **Pipenv**, use the following command to install from **Pipfile**:

```bash
$ pipenv install
```

...and active the environment:
```bash
$ pipenv shell
```

However, if you are using **Virtualenv**, you need to activate the environment and install from **requirements.pip** file:

```bash
$ source YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_DIRECTORY/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.pip
```

### Database
Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in your machine and be sure **MongoDB** process is running.

## How to run

```bash
$ python todo.py
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

API Endpoints:
- `GET /tasks`: Return all tasks available
- `POST /tasks`: Create a new task

## Testing (Optional)

You can test the application using the development dependencies.

Install all development dependencies from **Pipfile**:
```bash
$ pipenv install --dev
```

Or from **dev-requirements.pip** file if you are using **VirtualEnv**:
```bash
$ pip install -r dev-requirements.pip
```

To debug endpoints, you can use [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) as following:
```bash
$ http http://127.0.0.1:5000/tasks
[
  {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "5ad3d924e3bdea6ccf9d9d3e"
    },
    "description": "The Best Description",
    "done": false,
    "title": "The Best Title"
  },
  {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "5ad3d8fae3bdea6c41d571f4"
    },
    "description": "The Incredible Description",
    "done": false,
    "title": "The Incredible Title"
  }
]
```

```bash
$ http POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/tasks title=Test description=Test
HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED
Content-Length: 123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "5ad3ed11e3bdea06aa7afa06"
  },
  "description": "Test",
  "done": false,
  "title": "Test"
}
```

To run the tests, you can use [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) as following:
```bash
$ python -m pytest
...

test_todo.py .......                                                    [100%]
